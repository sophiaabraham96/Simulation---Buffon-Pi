# Simulation---Buffon-Pi
## Problem 
Write a program using MATLAB that
would simulate tossing the needle thousands of times to find the value of pi. 
## Methodology 
* Plot x and y coordinate for one side of needle 
* Generate random slope 
* Find delta x and y for other end of line  
* Set x and y for other end of needle 
* Plot line between both points 
* Fit line to a linear function 
* Generate parallel lines for grid
* Calculate intersections of generated needle lines with parallel grid lines 

## Inputs 
* Number of tosses 
* Length of one side of the square 
* Number of grid divisions
* Length of needle
